- 👋 My name is Colin and I am a mathematician. 
- 👀 I solve mathematical problems - from fixing a headache in your spreadsheet to helping you park your autonomous submarine. My PhD was in the Magnetic Topology Of The Solar Corona, but was really more about 3D geometry and drawing pretty graphs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to tidy up my Python, refresh my SQL and dabble in pandas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the world a better place. 
- 📫 You can reach me at colin@colinbeveridge.co.uk
